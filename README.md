# Timesheets App

## Welcome to my Sinatra app!

Here a user can create an account and then add the days they worked. Users will be able to see a list of all of the inputed workdays, however each person can only edit/ delete the workdays that belong to them. 

Each user can:
- View all of their workdays
- Choose from their list of workdays to edit or create a new one
- Input the appropriate dates(s) and times to reflect how long they worked and add a description
- Delete any of their inputed dates

## Install Instructions

To begin using this app, clone the repo, run $ bundle install, $ rake db:migrate, and then $ shotgun
