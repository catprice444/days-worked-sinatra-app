Welcome to my Sinatra app!

Here a user can create an account and then add the days they worked. A user can create, edit, delete and show a list of their workdays. 

- A user will be able to view all of their workdays
- Choose from their list of workdays to edit or create a new one
- Be able to input the appropriate dates(s) and times to reflect how long they worked and add a description
- Be able to delete any of their inputed dates
